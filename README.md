# Medical Signal Segmentation and Classification

This project focuses on applying image processing and machine learning techniques to medical signals using MRI datasets and the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. It was developed as part of a lab assignment at the University of Sydney.

##  Key Topics
- MRI visualization (axial, sagittal, coronal)
- Edge detection (Sobel, Prewitt, Canny)
- K-Means clustering for segmentation
- Spatial frequency filtering
- SVM-based classification on the Pima diabetes dataset

##  Files
- `MedicalSignalLab2.ipynb`: Colab notebook containing the full implementation.
- `annotated-SignalsLab2.pdf`: Detailed report with visualizations and explanations.

##  Highlights
- Visualized MRI slices in grayscale for different anatomical planes.
- Applied edge detection and clustering for segmentation.
- Trained and evaluated an SVM classifier, achieving ~74% accuracy.

##  Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, OpenCV, scikit-image

##  Note
This project was built for academic purposes. Code may reflect experimentation and partial data.
